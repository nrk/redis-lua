  * Support for WATCH / MULTI / EXEC check-and-set transactions through 
    coroutines.
 
  * Transactions can take a single string for watch_key as well as a 
    table.
  
v2.0.0 (2010-xx-xx)
  * The client library is no longer compatible with Redis 1.0.

  * Support for long names of Redis commands has been dropped, the client now 
    uses the same command names as defined by Redis.

  * Inline and bulk requests are not supported anymore and the related code 
    has been removed from the library. Commands are defined as multibulk 
    requests by default.

  * The public interface for pipelining has been slightly changed (see the 
    examples/pipeline.lua file for more details).

  * The public interface for Redis transactions (MULTI/EXEC) basically works 
    in the same way of pipelining.

  * Developers can now define their own commands at module level and not only 
    on client instances.

v1.0.1 (2010-07-30)
  * Providing a more generalized version of the multibulk request serializer.

  * _G is now passed as the argument of a pipeline block. This will change in 
    a future major release of redis-lua, but for now it is useful to enable 
    the usage of global functions inside of a pipeline block.

  * Fix: user-added commands were not available when pipelining commands.

v1.0.0 (2010-06-02)
  * First versioned release of redis-lua
